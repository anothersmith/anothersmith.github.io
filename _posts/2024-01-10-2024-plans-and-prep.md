# Racing Dreams and Ducati Delights: A 2024 Preview

Buckle up, fellow racers and riders! As I warm up my engines for another thrilling year of racing, I can't help but be excited for the adventures that await in 2024. This year, I'm setting my sights on the Desmo Due Cup class A podium with NG Racing Club. In preparation for this, the Spanish tracks are calling and my Ducati Monster 620 Sport and I are gearing up for the challenge. In February I will once again be off to Cartegena to blow out the cobwebs, shake down the bike a little and learn what I can about this new machine. At the end of last season, I made an early switch to class A and managed a 4th position in my first race and that was just my just getting comfortable. Hopefully, I can build on that and maybe get my foot on the first step of the podium.

## Suspension Shenanigans

One of my goals for this Spanish rendezvous is to turn my Ducati into a two-wheeled ballet dancer, gracefully gliding through each corner with the precision of a masterful salsa dancer. Testing various suspension setups might sound like a tech-heavy task, but in reality, it's all about finding that sweet spot between comfort and control. Imagine my bike, not just tearing up the track but waltzing through it with finesse! As much of a cliche it is, I'm fastest when I can ride slow. If I can get the bike dialed in as I like I'm hoping I can find that flow state much quicker. Once that's there then the speed comes easily. Last year I managed it only once at Donington when despite being down on power by about 10% I still managed to fight from 5th to take a win.

## The Shakedown Shuffle

Last year's trip uncovered a few gremlins with my 600 ss Ducati, notably brake issues and a wheel-bearing debacle (consequently also the same issue that ended my 2022 season, I thought it was the brake master but it was the slightest play in the front wheel bearing). This time around, I'm determined to give my new steed a thorough and successful shakedown. No loose bolts or hidden quirks are getting past me! Armed with the lessons of the past, my goal is to have the bike purring like a content Italian kitten by the end of the trip. Let's just say, I'm leaving no stone unturned in the quest for ultimate track time.

## Lap Time Redemption

Ah, the sweet satisfaction of redemption. Last year's lap times will serve as a decent benchmark, and this time, I'm out for glory. Aiming to beat my 2-minute record by a few seconds at least, the Spanish tarmac is about to witness the Ducati Monster 620 S in all its glory. Armed with a faster bike and potentially upgraded front suspension ( thanks to [Link to FTR suspension](https://ftrsuspension.co.uk 'FTR suspension') I'll be pushing my limits, taking each corner with newfound confidence, and maybe a sprinkle of audacity. Who knows, this might just be the year when my bike and I work together to take the championship! unlikely but its good to dream!

## Looking Ahead to 2024

As I reflect on the past year, I acknowledge that my racing didn't perform as well as I'd hoped and as a result the blog posts never came. A few unexpected sickness bugs and missed rounds threw a wrench into the works. But fear not, dear readers, for 2024 is shaping up to be the comeback we've all been waiting for. With my eyes set on the Desmo Due Cup racing with NG Racing Club, I'm ready to conquer new challenges and share the highs and lows of my racing journey. Here's to better prep, fewer bugs, and making 2024 a year to remember in the world of amateur motorcycle racing!

As I give one final rev of my engine before heading into the Spanish sunset, I can't help but feel the excitement bubbling within. This trip isn't just about testing suspensions and going over every nut and bolt of my bike's components; it's a celebration of passion, camaraderie, and the relentless pursuit of improvement. Here's to the twists and turns that lie ahead, both on the Spanish tracks and in the exhilarating journey of my 2024 race season. Vamos! üèçÔ∏èüá™üá∏
